Title: Real-Time Face Detection System

This project develops a real-time face detection system using computer vision techniques.

Technologies Used:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image
- Framework: Haar Cascades and Deep Learning
- Dataset: OpenCV Face Detection Dataset

Approach:

1. Image Preprocessing: Images are converted to grayscale and normalized.
2. Face Detection: Haar Cascades and Deep Learning models (SSD and YOLO) are used for face detection.
3. Model Training: Models are trained on the OpenCV Face Detection Dataset.
4. Real-Time Detection: The system detects faces in real-time using a webcam feed.
